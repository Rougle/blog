     [:p "I'm a software developer with university background. I have mostly worked in various areas
     of web development, but I don't feel a need to lock myself to it and call myself a web developer as I feel I could
     tackle other areas of software development as well. In addition to slacking I spend my freetime on music and
     occasional game development with Godot - although the latter has been on hiatus and hasn't really resulted
     in anything publish worthy.

     I play guitar as my main instrument. I have fiddled with bass, piano and drums too but wouldn't call myself
     a player of those instruments. I'm also by no means a professional musician or producer, but
     if you happen to need a soundtrack for a game or mod I would be happy to participate. Check contact page
     for soundcloud and ways to get in touch."]]))
